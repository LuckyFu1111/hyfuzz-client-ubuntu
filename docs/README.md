## Audience Map

- **Operators** ‚Äì Focus on setup, usage, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- **Protocol engineers** ‚Äì Review protocols, fuzzing, instrumentation, and notebooks.
- **Security analysts** ‚Äì Use crash analysis, reporting, and target management guides.
- **Contributors** ‚Äì Combine this documentation with repository-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` and
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Conventions

- Commands are written for Ubuntu 22.04+. Prefix with `sudo` when required.

- Configuration examples use YAML fragments and environment variables stored in `.env`.
- Symbols:
  - ‚úÖ indicates tasks validated during Phase 3 acceptance.
  - ‚öôÔ∏è denotes configuration knobs that may require tuning per deployment.
  - üß™ highlights instrumentation or analysis steps that can generate heavy load.
